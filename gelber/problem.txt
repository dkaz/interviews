1. Develop an application in Java that will satisfy the following requirements:

- Read in any number of files text files.
- Calculate 5 most commonly used letters
- Calculate 3 most commonly used characters
- Calculate 3 most commonly used numbers
- Calculate 10 most commonly used words
- Concurrently parse all files, however, limit your application to 2 parser threads.  If there are more files than available parser threads, you will need to queue files for parsing.
